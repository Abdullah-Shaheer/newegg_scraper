## Newegg Web Scraping Project (Reverse Engineering)

### 📝 Project Overview
This project involved scraping product data from **Newegg** by reverse engineering their APIs. Using reverse engineering techniques, I was able to access data from hidden API endpoints to efficiently extract relevant product details.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Requests**: To make API calls and retrieve product data.
- **JSON**: For parsing and processing the API responses.
- **Pandas**: To structure and organize the scraped data.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Identifying and interacting with private API endpoints to bypass standard scraping restrictions.

### 📊 Data Extracted
The data was scraped for up to **20 fields** including, but not limited to:
- Product titles
- Prices
- Ratings and reviews
- Specifications
- Seller details
- Shipping information
- Product URLs

### 🚀 Features
- **Reverse Engineering**: Leveraged reverse engineering to uncover hidden API endpoints, bypassing traditional web scraping techniques.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Extracted up to **20 fields** of valuable product information.
- **Data Export**: The scraped data was exported into **CSV**, **JSON** and **EXCEL** formats for easy use and further analysis.

### ✅ Successful Outcome
The project successfully scraped and extracted the required data, providing the client with **comprehensive product details** in a structured format. The use of reverse engineering allowed for more efficient and accurate data retrieval, surpassing traditional web scraping methods.
